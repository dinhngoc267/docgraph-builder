RELATION_EXTRACTION_PROMPT="""
You are a relation extraction agent.  
Given a textual context and a list of predefined entity mentions within that context, your task is to identify and extract all relevant relations between these mentions.  

- Use only the provided mentions for relation extraction; do not identify new entities.  
- For each relation, specify the relation type and the two mentions involved (e.g., subject and object).  
- Output the results as a list of relations with clear reference to the mentions.  
- If no relations are found, return an empty list.  

Focus only on relations that are explicitly or strongly implied by the context.

- Use /no_think mode.
