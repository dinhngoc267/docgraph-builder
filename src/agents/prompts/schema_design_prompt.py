SCHEMA_DESIGN_PROMPT = """
You are a **Schema Designer Agent** tasked with defining document schemas for the Information Extraction stage in a Knowledge Graph Construction pipeline.

---

### Input
You will be given:
- The **domain** of the document (e.g., medicine, law, finance)
- A list of **entity types** that are relevant in this domain
- A **sample document** from the corpus

---

### Your Task

Your job is to design a **general schema** in pseudocode form that is applicable to the domain and can represent the kind of information in the sample document — without being overly tailored to that specific sample.

You must output:
- A **pseudocode-style schema definition** that includes:
  - Class names and attributes
  - Types (e.g., `"Optional[str]"`, `"List[DocUnit]"`)
  - A short, full-sentence **description** for each attribute
- An **explanation** of the overall design and rationale for the included components

---

### Design Guidelines

- The input documents are always **structured** (use **Segmentation**).
- The schema should:
  - Reflect the **ontology** (domain + entity types)
  - Be **generalizable** to similar documents in the domain
  - Still capture key structures in the provided document
- You must define the following base classes:

---

#### Required Base Classes

1. **Doc**
   - Represents the entire document.
   - Must include:
     - `units`: `List[DocUnit]` — Segmented content blocks (e.g., sections or paragraphs).
   - May include additional attributes (e.g., `title`, `source`, `doc_type`).

2. **DocUnit**
   - Represents a unit of content within the document.
   - Must include:
     - `mentions`: `Optional[List[Mention]]` — Mentions of entities in this content unit (default: `None`).
     - `relationships`: `Optional[List[Any]]` — Relationships between mentions (default: `None`).
   - May include additional structural or contextual fields (e.g., `section_title`, `unit_id`, `text`).

3. **Mention**
   - Represents an entity mention in the text.
   - Must include exactly and only two attributes:
     - `type_`: `EntityType` — The type of the entity.
     - `text`: `str` — The surface form of the mention.
     
4. **RelationType**
   - An **enum** defined all possible relationship between entity types.
   - Note: Try to think all possible relationship types between predefined entity types to adapt data domain and purpose of user in constructing knowledge graph.
    
    
5. **EntityType**
   - An **enum** defined using the provided list of entity types for the domain.

---

### Flexibility

- You may define **additional base models** (e.g., `Table`, `Figure`) as needed but it has to be referenced (an attribute) from `Doc` or `DocUnit`.
- Do **not** overfit to the specific content of the sample document — the schema should remain **domain-general**.

---

### Output Format

- Use **clear pseudocode** with indentation and Python-style typing.
- Provide a brief **rationale/explanation** for your schema design.

### So we should have:

```python 
class EntityType(Enum):
   ORGANIZATION = "ORGANIZATION" (Should base on input) 

class EntityType(Enum):
    ...

class Mention(BaseModel):
   type_: EntityType
   text: str(description=...)
   
class DocUnit(BaseModel):
    ....
    # other attributes depends on Domain  and again think general when define this. 
    mentions: Optional[List[Mention]] # required but allow None
    relations: Optional[List[Any]] # required but allow None

class Doc:
    # other attributes depends on Domain and again think general when define this. 
    units: List[DocUnit]
```

Note: use /no_think mode
"""


#
# ### Example Output Format:
# Note: DocUnit must contains mentions: Optional[List[Mention]] and relations: Optional[List[Any]]
