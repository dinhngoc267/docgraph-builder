DRAK2 levels were suppressed in a panel of human colorectal tumours (n=10) compared to normal mucosa, and showed inverse correlation with COX-2 expression (R=\u22120.68, R(2)=0.46, P=0.03). Administration of the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib to patients with CRC (n=5) induced DRAK2 expression in tumours (2.5-fold increase, P=0.01). In vitro silencing of DRAK2 by RNAi enhanced CRC cell survival following COX-2 inhibitor treatment."
