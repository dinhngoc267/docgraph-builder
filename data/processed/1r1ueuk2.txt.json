      "text": "The mechanisms responsible for virulence of influenza viruses in humans remain poorly understood. A prevailing hypothesis is that the highly pathogenic virus isolates cause a severe cytokinemia precipitating acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) infected with a human highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus isolate (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) or reassortants of human influenza virus A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1) containing genes from the 1918 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus developed severe pneumonia within 24 h postinfection. However, virus spread beyond the lungs was only detected in the H5N1 group, and signs of extrapulmonary tissue reactions, including microglia activation and sustained up-regulation of inflammatory markers, most notably hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), were largely limited to this group. Extrapulmonary pathology may thus contribute to the morbidities induced by H5N1 viruses.",
