Content: RNA–RNA recombination is an important pathway in virus evolution and has been described for many viruses. However, the factors driving recombination or promoting the selection of recombinants are still unclear. Here, we show that the small movement protein (2b) was able to promote selection of RNA 1/2–RNA 3 recombinants within a chimeric virus having RNAs 1 and 2 from cucumber mosaic virus, and RNA 3 from the related tomato aspermy virus, along with heterologous 2b genes. The source of the 2b also determined the selection of the acceptor RNA and the crossover site, as well as affecting the rate of selection of the recombinant RNAs. The nature of the RNA 3 also influenced the selection of the recombinant RNAs. A 163-nt tandem repeat in RNA 3 significantly affected the rate of selection of the recombinant RNA, while a single nucleotide within the repeat affected the crossover site. The recombination occurred in a non-random manner, involved no intermediates and probably was generated via a copy-choice mechanism during (+) strand RNA synthesis.
