 Abstract
: segregation. Hence, our data do not confirm the diagnostic potential of the M protein sequence nor do they support the suggested role of the membrane protein in FIP pathogenesis (9) .
Informative as it may be, comparative sequence analysis will eventually not be sufficient to answer the FECV/FIPV question. What will be needed is a reverse genetics system to generate and manipulate the FCoV genome as well as a cell culture system to propagate the viruses, both of which have thus far not been achieved.
