Title:Use of controlled low dose gamma irradiation to sterilize allograft tendons for ACL reconstruction: biomechanical and clinical perspective
Authors: ['Samsell, Brian J.', 'Moore, Mark A.']
Content: As reviewed here, numerous biomechanical and clinical studies support the use of controlled, low temperature irradiation of allograft tendons, to provide both excellent clinical results and medical-device grade sterile allografts with minimal risk of disease transmission.
