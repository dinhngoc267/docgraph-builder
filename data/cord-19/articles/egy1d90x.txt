Content: Following intracranial inoculation, neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains induce acute inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss in the CNS. Prior studies using recombinant MHV strains that differ only in the spike gene, which encodes a glycoprotein involved in virus-host cell attachment, demonstrated that spike mediates anterograde axonal transport of virus to the spinal cord. A demyelinating MHV strain induces optic neuritis, but whether this is due to retrograde axonal transport of viral particles to the retina, or if it is due to traumatic disruption of retinal ganglion cell axons during intracranial inoculation is not known. Using recombinant isogenic MHV strains, we examined the ability of recombinant MHV to induce optic neuritis by retrograde spread from the brain through the optic nerve into the eye following intracranial inoculation. Recombinant demyelinating MHV induced macrophage infiltration of optic nerves, demyelination and axonal loss whereas optic neuritis and axonal injury were minimal in mice infected with the non-demyelinating MHV strain that differs in the spike gene. Thus, optic neuritis was dependent on a spike glycoprotein-mediated mechanism of viral antigen transport along retinal ganglion cell axons. These data indicate that MHV spreads by retrograde axonal transport to the eye and that targeting spike protein interactions with axonal transport machinery is a potential therapeutic strategy for CNS viral infections and associated diseases.
